            The Mikoyan MiG-29 (Russian: Микоян МиГ-29; NATO reporting name: Fulcrum) is a twin-engine jet fighter aircraft designed
            in the Soviet Union. Developed by the Mikoyan design bureau as an air superiority fighter during the 1970s, the MiG-29,
            along with the larger Sukhoi Su-27, was developed to counter new U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle
            and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The MiG-29 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1982.

            While originally oriented towards combat against any enemy aircraft, many MiG-29s have been furnished as multirole
            fighters capable of performing a number of different operations, and are commonly outfitted to use a range of
            air-to-surface armaments and precision munitions. The MiG-29 has been manufactured in several major variants, including
            the multirole Mikoyan MiG-29M and the navalised Mikoyan MiG-29K; the most advanced member of the family to date is the
            Mikoyan MiG-35. Later models frequently feature improved engines, glass cockpits with HOTAS-compatible flight controls,
            modern radar and infrared search and track (IRST) sensors, and considerably increased fuel capacity; some aircraft have
            also been equipped for aerial refueling.
