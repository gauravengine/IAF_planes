            The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21  is a supersonic jet fighter
            and interceptor aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau in the Soviet Union. Its nicknames include:
            Balalaika, because its planform resembles the stringed musical instrument of the same name; Ołówek, Polish for "pencil",
            due to the shape of its fuselage, and Én Bạc, meaning "Silver Swallow", in Vietnamese.

            Approximately 60 countries over four continents have flown the MiG-21, and it still serves many nations six decades
            after its maiden flight. It made aviation records, became the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history,
            the most-produced combat aircraft since the Korean War and previously the longest production run of a combat aircraft
            (now exceeded by both the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon).
